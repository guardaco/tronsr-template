Guarda Wallet is a non-custodial multi currency crypto wallet supporting well over 50 Blockchains and thousands of tokens, including TRON and all TRON-based tokens. The wallet is available on Web, Desktop, Chrome Extension, iOS and Android platforms. Guarda Wallet has been actively participating in the TRON blockchain life for quite a lot of time. Apart from providing the ability to store, send, receive TRON and TRON-based tokens, it provides the opportunity to buy and swap TRON (TRX) directly inside the wallet. Moreover, it is possible for TRON holders to earn passive income by staking TRON, which is also supported on Guarda.
Recently, Guarda Wallet has decided to expand the level of participation in the TRON ecosystem and launched its own Super Representative Partner Tron node, so now it is also providing security to the blockchain. It is also worth mentioning that Guarda has been actively participating in the TRON conferences for the last few years, where it had the chance to talk about TRON blockchain and ecosystem, wallet development and more.
Guarda is truly open to brand-new features and new exciting tech, which means we will also be open to support more TRON features whenever they will come out.
